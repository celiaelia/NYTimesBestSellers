# NYTimesBestSellers

This project makes use of NYTimesBestSellers API to display the best sellers lists (referred to in the project as Categories). After the user selects a list, the books on it are shown. The user can select a book from that list to see its details. Viewed lists are saved locally in the device for offline use.

To use it, just download the project and run 'pod install' in the terminal to add its dependencies(Alamofire and SwiftyJSON). Created mainly to be used with any iPhone, iOS9+. Autolayout is used but it may not look perfect on iPad and/or portrait view. 

Created using Swift 3.
